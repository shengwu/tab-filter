Here is one simple example that says it all, the first few measures of the first break in the song \u201cLivin\u2019 on the Mountain,\u201d from Keith and Rooney\u2019s album of the same name.  Keith took one of Scruggs\u2019s standard licks, employing a forward-backward roll with a pull-off on the third string, and threw in a subtle twist by pulling off to the fifth string and pivoting to the open third.  Compare Keith\u2019s version to Scruggs\u2019s in the tab, and you will get my drift.  When I heard this in 1963 or 1964, I realized that Bill Keith had opened new horizons on the banjo."

The tune doesn't sound particularly Irish to start with, but the banjo treatment here really makes it sound like something from the Old West. The process is probably a more conscious attempt to emulate something in modern times that evolved naturally historically. I've rated the difficulty here as beginner despite a small amount of drop-thumbing. I quite like this version, and I hope you do too, but now I have to decide whether this is just the starting point, and whether or not I should continue on with some fancier variations. Cheers!"

It probably helps to hear the original recording, which you can find on www.sugarmegs.org.  Crowe's break ends on a whimsical statement of the melody, and you can find this concert recording also on sugarmegs."

The two breaks presented here are the melody and a variation closely based on the melody. It has some rolls that are kinda difficult to pull off at higher speeds, mainly the \"Dixie Breakdown Roll\", so practice, of course, is in order. A rarely played gem; teach it to your local jam and you'll have a blast! Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

I thought about adding the triplet guitar rhythm to really make it sound like the Beatles, but ended up not adding it because it muddied the arrangement.  If you want to hear how the triplets would have changed the arrangement, I left part of it in module 5 of the TablEdit file.  Enjoy!"

The rhythm of the melody has been banjo-fied somewhat, though the chords (still open, Bluegrass chords) are authentic, including a flat-five chord. It's still more of a bluegrass take on a jazz tunes more than jazz banjo. Has some Reno in it. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

And it will not be sounded on the midi file (all ppp notes are silent). Or if you make a pdf of it, the [2] will not be shown.\nThe alternate hammer on is in the same way. Write a fake unfretted note:\n1.\tWrite 0 (fret 2) on the first string on the \u201cbum\u201d\n2.\tPut a Ho (Hammer on) on it\n3.\tWrite 2 on the first string on the \u201cpa\u201d\n4.\tPut the cursor on first \u201cfake\u201d note (0)\n5.\tIn the dynamics bar choose ppp.\n\n"

I asked Ira Gitlin, a fabulous teacher and wonderful contributor to the Hangout, and he suggested Amazing Grace. There weren't any tabs here that I liked very much, so I came up with this.  The first time through is super simple, and has mostly melody notes with a few fills.  The second time through is a little more complicated and incorporates some melodic elements.  The third includes a simple vamping backup using closed chord positions."

        "desc": "Notes: \u201cAnd the Cat Came Back The Very Next Day\u201d, from Doc Roberts:  I have long been an admirer of Doc\u2019s fiddling. He infuses his rich repertoire of tunes with a distinct bluesy sound characterized by powerful, yet smooth bowing and remarkably clear intonation.\nFirst, I learned to play this tune on the fiddle.  Eventually I was able to eke out a fair approximation of The Cat.  I would dust it off from time to time, but really did not fully commit to it, in part because I didn\u2019t feel fully confident in my fiddling.  But of course, it kept coming back, insisting that I give it the attention it deserved, so that now it lays curled up comfortably at the fire amongst the other familiar G tunes.\nI suppose it became jealous of my time on the banjo, so slyly crept into my clawhammer fingers, where it sits now as a banjo favorite.\nOne of the charms of Doc\u2019s fiddle version, is how the tune wanders in no obvious pattern  (at least to me) between what I am labeling the A, B, and C parts.  In order to share more easily with others, I play it as AABBCC.\nA brief bio of Doc Roberts compiled from the internet (Wikipedia and other sources)\nDock Philipine Roberts was born in 1898 near Kirksville, Madison County, and learned to play the fiddle at an early age with some help from his older brother Liebert. Doc's and Liebert's musical mentor was the African-American fiddler Owen Walker who was born in 1857, and taught Roberts most of his tunes. After finishing his studies in Berea Roberts married in 1913. In 1925, a talent scout, Dennis Taylor, recruited Roberts along with Welby Toomey and Edgar Boaz as old time recording artists for Gennet Records In early 1927, Roberts recorded with the string band, the \"Booker Family\".  Together with Dick Parman and Ted Chestnut, he formed the Kentucky Thorobreds. They recorded in April 1927 for Paramount.\nIn the fall of 1927, teamed up with Asa Martin as Martin & Roberts. They made their recording debut in May 1928 for the Gennett label. Between 1927-1934, the duo performed at fiddler's conventions, in schoolhouses, on vaudeville stages, and on radio (WHAS in Louisville, Kentucky). Martin & Roberts recorded altogether more than 200 sides on 11 different labels. Later on, with the addition of Doc Roberts' son James, the Fiddlin' Doc Roberts Trio was formed. In 1928, Roberts was hired, through the agency of Bradley Kincaid, by the National Barn Dance radio show in Chicago . He was paid $50 a week. After only two weeks he quit the show and moved back to Kentucky because he was unable to sleep due to the noise of the big city. The Doc Roberts Trio lasted until 1934 when Roberts retired as a recording artist. During the next 4 decades, he continued to make personal appearances and occasional radio works.\nHe died at the age of 81 in his hometown of Richmond.\n\nThe Cat Came Back:\n\nI first heard \u201cThe Cat Came Back\u201d as a camp song.  The melody in Doc\u2019s version, seemed completely separate from my vague memory of that song, so I didn\u2019t give it much more thought. However, in preparation for this post, I conducted an internet search and quickly discovered 1) The first commercial recording of \"The Cat Came Back\" was by Fiddlin\u2019 John Carson (OKeh 40119) in April 1924. It doesn\u2019t sound at all like Doc\u2019s version \"And The Cat Came Back The Very Next Day\", recorded on Gennett 3235 on November 13, 1925.  However, the Fiddlin\u2019 John\u2019s version appears directly related the Harry S. Miller Song of 1893:  \"The Cat Came Back: A Nigger Absurdity.\" Ouch!  The racism that runs through much of American popular culture is revealed again.   I don\u2019t like reporting this, but just thought you should know.\n"

I had seen requests for 'Another Morning Part B' on the forums here, so I thought I'd post the TEF file. ( I'm hoping some kind and more experienced member could easily use Tabledit to cut and paste over to appropriately tuned banjo and clean up, since I'd have no idea! )\n\nFor \"part B\" of this tune, Bela does a variety of counter-melodies/rhythms behind the dobro, which carries the main melody +/- 'chords'. I made a solo guitar practice arrangement\n~ capturing the total effect, most of the banjo, and the dobro accent/sustain where needed. I think I captured all the main melodic/rhythmic motifs Bela uses, which can be combined in endless ways over the basic chords/rhythm. I think my arrangement is essentially 'Scruggs-style' rolls, mostly w/a low-profile bassline below, and occasionally more typical 'guitar strum' chords (kind of approximating banjo/bass/'chop' trio).\n\nEDIT (8/04/2011): updated w/better approximation of dobro slide @ end of intro."

I have also seen Jim play this tune with the banjo tuned aDGAD.  He never picks anything twice the same way."

It's a clawhammer version in G, but can be played solo in Bb (A#) so capo 3 from G (or tune up 3 frets). To play along with the 2nd South Carolina version Youtube link, play in G, remembering that this version is played on a Minstrel Banjo, and has a more haunting sound to it.

Bill plays it in A (capo up 2).  Thanks to Bill for clarifying how he plays the B part.  It is a tough tune to master, but well worth the effort.  You might find, for example, that some of the ideas in the B part can be incorporated into a variety of other tunes."

There are 2 and a half breaks, the first 2 are adaptions of standard fiddle breaks, with the outro half-break being some doodlings of my own. It might take some convincing to get your jam to do it in F instead of the more common bluegrass keys of D or C, but it's worth it. Has a Texas-ish-style Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

It was a thrill to see him with Jim and Jesse at the University of Chicago Folk Festival in 1966, where he wowed the audience (and me) with his banjo prowess.  Bending the Strings is a clever original piece by Shelton, and one that involves the use of Keith/Scruggs tuners.  I read somewhere that he wrote it when he was a teenager, an indication of how talented he was.  I have tabbed it so you can play it without D tuners, although I have indicated above the tab the proper moves if you have tuners.  The first break resembles the way Shelton played BTS, but it is not note-for-note.  The second break is reminiscent of Bill Keith's version and includes some neat ideas.  You can find Keith's recording of it on his 1992 CD \"Beating Around the Bush,\" which should be in every bluegrass banjo player's collection."

Sonny Osborne and Birchfield played twin banjos on the opening and closing breaks, and each took a solo break as well, of course interspersed with mandolin breaks by Bobby Osborne -- but I can report that there were no drum breaks.  My arrangement captures the feel of the original recording, without attempting to be note-for-note, and without the mandolin breaks."

Influenced by several sources.\n\nI don't include fingering because in most case it's obvious and I assume anyone who plays melodics has their preferred ways of getting at the basic formations that come up in this arrangement. I will note that there's some use of middle finger on 2nd string, usually at the top end of a forward roll. In measure 19, for the 3-note backward roll starting on 2nd string I actually use my index finger for both 2nd and 3rd strings. It's non-conventional, but it works for me, especially at the moderate tempo of this tune. You're free to use middle on 2nd for a true 3-finger backward roll, as Tony Trischka and Bela Fleck would.  Thank you to Hangout member Sam Parks for letting me use the guitar, mandolin and bass tracks from his TablEdit file. Saved me a lot of time."

I now play the first two notes as a drop thumb, index on open 1st string, to thumb while fingering the 4th fret on the 2nd string. This change is also at the end of the 4th measure where the phrase repeats. I hope you all will not have trouble with the old Banjo Newsletter tab form in which the numbers appear in the spaces. In my tab, I've corrected the incorrect tuning, in that it was printed backwards in the Banjo Newsletter in 6/78."

        "desc": "Notes: The classic show-piece for fiddle, \"Black Mountain Blues/Rag\" arranged here for Scruggs/Reno style banjo (capo 2). This piece is difficult at a medium tempo, let alone the burning fast velocity it sounds best (in my opinion) at. The 2nd chorus is an example of Don Reno's continuous roll pattern, which is a forward roll with no breaks until the end of the chorus. Thus it sounds almost too syncopated, and the timing is down with a lot of pull-offs & hammer-ons. I have experimented with a triple pull-off \u00e1 la Don's \"Green Mountain Hop\", (which is this same piece albeit in the key of D), to imitate the \"crazy\" fiddle part (you have to hear the tune to know what I'm talking about). Needless to say it's quite difficult at any tempo! There are a few small single string parts in the first two A sections, which are kinda difficult to pull off cleanly. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track, as well as a guitar kick-off. Have fun!"

I have added optional fermatas, but these only come into play when one is slowing it way down (not as the country waltz)."

He subsequently recorded it with the supergroup Muleskinner, in 1973.  Bill\u2019s breaks were delightful and stayed close to the melody, unlike the excursions into banjo noise practised by many of his successors, and they were played at breakneck knuckle-busting speed.  For an example of the cleverness of his break, note how he used ascending scales in the first run-through of the A part and then descending scales in the second run-through.  Brilliant.  Catch the video of Muleskinner on youtube.com, to see a young and bearded Bill Keith playing some outstanding banjo on BB and a bunch of other tunes.\n\nThe tab I have posted here is pretty close to the way I hear Bill playing it, and I give you two of his endings, the first from the Billy Baker recording and the second from Muleskinner.  Note that the backup chord structure can be complex as in the tab and Muleskinner recording, or simple as in the Billy Baker recording.  Either way it\u2019s a great tune."

It's a banjo version of the guitar part, no melody and since it is a duet with guitar and voice, I didn't indicate the chords. I based it on the original recording from the \"white album\" which is really titled The Beatles, can't find it on the internet...buy the album, you won't be sorry."

In its deceptive simplicity and elegance it ranks up there with his break to \"No Mother or Dad,\" in my opinion -- it is a break in which he really plays the words.  The first break by Scruggs is my attempt to capture his recorded version with Lester Flatt, and the second break is an amalgam of variations I have heard on various radio and concert recordings by Flatt and Scruggs.  The next 2 breaks are my own, with some elements based on Bill Keith's playing.  Flatt and Scruggs recorded BRCH in B flat; so capo up 3 if you want to play along with the recording."

Also has an unusual variant of G tuning (gBGBD) capoed at 2nd fret for the key of A (aC#AC#E). Melvin's father wouldn't let him touch his fiddle, but Melvin would play it while his father was away from the house. This is the first tune Melvin played for his father and that convinced him to let young Melvin continue to play his fiddle. Thanks to Carl Baron for clearing up many things about this arrangement. You can Melvin play this tune at Slippery Hill or Bearea archives."

The low A part uses a lot of left hand ornamentation, so some may find the high A part easier. For the B part the roles reverse. The high B part requires playing and staying up around the 10th fret compared to the low B part which never leaves first position. For this reason the easiest way to start with the tune is probably mixing the octaves. I\u2019ve included a tab with this mixed configuration along with the tabs that stick to their octaves. No matter what octaves you choose, I recommend trying to stick pretty firmly to a bum-dit-ty pattern with a brush in the \u201cdit.\u201d This tune traditionally used a lot of drones and keeping the patter will help give that impression despite the short sustain of the banjo."

It's rather different from the older version, being much faster and having an altered melodic structure, but the link is evident with some study and playing it sure is fun.  To play the Stepp version on banjo one must use almost exclusively hammer-ons and pull-offs as the tune is a barrage of eighth notes alternating up and down the scale. With some practice it is doable, but it may take a while to get it up to speed. The A part is always the same, sans ornamentation, but there are two versions of the B part. The melodies are the same they are in different octaves (both in first position though). The traditional way of playing it is to play the low B on the first and the high B on the second. Repeat this cycle to the end of the tune.\n"

The tuning, gDGBE capoed at the 5th fret, gives you the same tuning as the Renaissance guitar, the instrument it was written for. Of course we have the added advantage of the fifth string, which I used a lot here (see bars 10, 12, and 27).  Enjoy!"

My version of this tune is constantly changing.  I use variations of this style through different verses, sometimes even including thumb/index pinched notes rather than rolls.  The tuning is gDGCD."

It is the same song sung by Andy Stewart as noted below:\n\nhttp://www.chivalry.com/cantaria/lyrics/broom-cowdenknowes.html\n\nNotes from Andy M. Stewart:\nThis song is easily traceable back to the early seventeenth century where it appears in a small collection as \"The Lovely Northerne Lass.\" Allan Ramsay also published a version in his \"Tea Table Miscellany\", during the 1720s. It is a moving tale of love, banishment and exile, supported by a very beautiful melody. Cowdenknowes is in Berwickshire, near to the village of Earlston, a place much associated with the 13th century poet and prophet, \"Thomas The Rhymer\".  I got this song years ago, from my friend and neighbour, Archie Fisher.\n\n\nThis example of \"The Broom of the Cowdenknowes\" is performed by Andy M. Stewart with Silly Wizard on the albums Wild and Beautiful and The Best of Silly Wizard, both available from the Chivalry Music store\nPlease refer to Cantaria's Copyright information\n\nCopyright Information\nThe purpose of Cantaria is to be an educational resource for aspiring bards and minstrels.

Also used repeated measures to try to keep pace with Rod's comic delay...to be able to play along somewhat with the video. No guarantee of accuracy, but it kinda works.\nIf you have corrections send them to me...I'll fix it."

        "desc": "Notes: Here is a Celtic fingerstyle setting using Double D tuning (Double C-Capo II) for the Old Time reel that goes under interchangeable titles. The titles create confusion since there are two main branches in Old Time and further regional, local and bluegrass variants. The A Part is pretty close in most versions with one noticeable variation \u2013 either dipping down to an A-note or rising up to F# in the second and sixth measures. (Here I dip down to the A-note in the sixth measure.) This variation is found in both Old Time and Bluegrass versions and a G chord is sometimes played in these spots (as I do here). It\u2019s in the B Part (fifth and sixth measures) where the melodic contour branches in one of two directions \u2013 either dipping down from the fifth (A) to the tonic (D)/D chord, or, as Paul Warren played it (New Five Cents), using a G-note double-stop with a B-note)/G chord, then up to an A-note/A chord and moving upwards happily in major second intervals. Many (but not all) Old Time versions (\u2018New Five Cents\u2019, \u2018Ruffled Drawers\u2019 or \u2018Buffalo Nickel\u2019) tend to keep dipping down to the low D-note/D chord and use fewer chords than Bluegrass versions which are based on Paul Warren\u2019s version. This setting uses a lot of fretting-hand ornamentation and makes for a lovely hornpipe."

Sheet music is available at http://thesession.org/tunes/\n\nAccording to http://www.nigelgatherer.com/whistle/tut_8/8-4.html:\n\"The English general Cumberland received the sobriquet 'Butcher' after the defeat of the Jacobite forces of Bonnie Prince Charlie at Culloden in 1746, such was the savagery of his reprisals and cruelty toward prisoners of the engagement. In the aftermath of the rising a series of laws were passed which aimed to suppress the Highland culture and break forever the power of the ancient clans in order to prevent any such rebellion from again happening. Thus, highland dress and the wearing of clan tartan was prohibited on pain of death, arms were banned, and, attesting to the power of traditional music to evoke emotion, pipers were outlawed. In fact, reports Williamson, the kilt continued to be prohibited until 1782, forcing the Highlanders to wear trews. Any clergyman who did not pray in church expressly for George of Hanover could be transported for life, and those who attended such services were liable to fine and imprisonment. This was in force till 1792. The Burning of the Piper's Hut probably refers to these times.\""

The tune works really well on the banjo in a relatively painless melodic style.  I first heard it played by Alan Munde under the title \"Banjalin,\" on his 1977 album with Sam Bush (Together Again for the First Time).  More recently I discovered an unreleased  version by Bill Keith from around 1963.  The first break is my own arrangement of Busy Fingers.  The second break is similar to one of Alan Munde's."

The tab is based on Keith\u2019s arrangement, and it is mostly the way I have played Caravan for the last few decades.  It is not a note-for-note copy of Keith\u2019s version, but I did include a number of his nifty ideas, or at least my interpretation of them, that are worth examining.   Note that in live performance Keith would start the tune with some appropriate noodling, and I have included a fragment in the tab.  Note also that the Intro includes the banjo\u2019s alternating between G7 and Ab Dim, whereas the backing instruments alternated between G7 and Ab7 throughout  Part A of the tune.  Finally, in his Outro to the tune Keith used a Keith tuner on the 4th string to go from D to C.  If you don\u2019t have a Keith tuner on your 4th string, you can just end it with a C note on the 2nd string 1st fret."

The first and third breaks should be played slowly, in the chordal style employing triplets, and you will probably need to employ the MIDI function on TablEdit to hear what they should sound like, because they way they look in tablature does not resemble how they sound.  I like to play the second break at a faster tempo, and the contrast between the slow and fast breaks makes a more interesting arrangement, I think.  The tablature shows the arrangement in drop C tuning, although it could be played just as easily in standard G tuning."

For reasons lost in the foggy mists of time, my band Silver Spring (in Vancouver, B.C., mid-1970s) changed the E minor to an E major and renamed it Cherokee Strut -- and note that the tune is typically played in the key of A; thus we are talking F# minor and F# major.  My tab includes 2 breaks, the first in conventional 3-finger style and the second incorporating more melodic sequences.  This was how I played more than 15 years before Bill Keith released his terrific arrangement.  The structure of the tune is AABB."

Although I have tabbed this out in G, you should capo up 3, so that the A part is in Gm (not Em) and the B part is in Bb (not G).  Speaking of the B part, it is my interpretation of Bill Keith's superb break on the album \"The David Grisman Rounder Compact Disc.\"  Although it is probably not note-for-note, the tab is a relatively close approximation of Bill's break, and there is lots of great stuff in it.  The A part is my version, and it is improvisational, as are the fiddle and mandolin breaks you will hear played in Cheyenne."

The descending part over the \"A\" chord in the first section is also kinda hard. This version goes to an E-minor chord one time in the second part. This is the way Kenny Baker (among a few others) played it. I label this \"Scruggs\" style, but there is also melodic & single string in there."

My arrangement is based on Bobby Hicks's outstanding fiddle break on Herschel Sizemore's recording \"Back in Business.\" You should play this thing at a good pace; the tab is at a tempo of 240.  Pay attention to the A chord in the first break, measures 12 and 13, which I based on Lee Marcus's tab that is no longer available on BHO.  I based the A to D passages in the second break, measures 36-38 and 44-47, on a break of Sonny Osborne's that I heard many years ago -- \"I Know What It Means to Be Lonesome\" perhaps."

The key is actually G Dorian, so there is one flat (Bb) in the key signature rather than the more conventional one sharp (F#)."

To achieve that Stanley sound, emphasize the 3-0 pulloff on the first string, as in the second and later measures.  (The rest of the arrangement is my own).  Incidentally, a very nice version of CMB was recorded by the Kentucky Colonels on their classic album \"Appalachian Swing,\" featuring sublime rhythm and lead guitar by the one-and-only Clarence White.  Note that the only tricky bit is measures 21 and 30, where the time signature changes to 2/4 just for those 2 measures -- this is the \"backstep.\"\n"

It starts with a down the neck arrangement, followed by melodic and up the neck arrangements, and closes out with two more down the neck arrangements. It is packed from one end to the other with interesting licks and ideas, but remains true to the original tune.\n\nI think this tab is very close to a fret for fret transcription. But be aware of one point. The fourth bar of the B section of Clinch Mountain backstep changes time signature to 6/4. When tabbing I couldn't get that to work with John's melodic arrangement. I contacted John who was kind enough to tell me that in his enthusiasm he had played through that part in 4/4. He was also kind enough to advise me how to correct the small error. So the tab won't quite match John's playing at that point in the tune. So follow the tab - particularly if you're playing it with other musicians."

Here is a rather different version that I heard years ago on a tape somebody made of Bill Keith.  Bill's version is close to the 1927 recording by The Hillbillies.  The chord structure can pretty much be what you want to make of it, and I have included one interpretation in the tab."

Dale Williams was their excellent banjo player, and my version overlaps a bit with his.  I have included a few variations, to show what can be done with the tune.  It is in A minor, played out of standard G tuning and capoed up two."

I also play this with a considerable amount of swing (bounce) which gives the tune an even more syncopated feeling. This is a cakewalk, similar to ragtime, though it could be sped up and played as a driving breakdown. Playing tip: as tempo increases, the more the bounce (degree of swing) tends to even out. The focus here is to demonstrate syncopation and accenting in Scruggs-style picking. Big thanks to Taj Mahal for this lovely tune."

I also changed the time signature from 2/4 to cut-time. Fun, fairly easy piece to play. Note that this is the fiddle tune and not the song from \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" Cheers!"

One of the finest old-time banjo & singing records ever. This is his second break to the tune (slightly more audible than the first break, which is probably the same). Tuning is D-Modal low bass, f#CGAD. A fairly quick old time number. Not too hard, and not too easy, either."

I have several variations (some subtle, some not so subtle) I play for instrumental breaks, which I hope to commit to tablature.  Feel free to play with the timing--add an extra beat or so here and there.  Or cut some short.  Have fun with it.  Play it fast or slow--it all sounds great!\n\nMeasures 5, 11, and 14 contain a figure that consists of a hammer on and plucked note sounding simultaneously.  You may omit either one.  They are the same note, so it will sound fine.  Measures 9 and 18 also contain a simultaneous hammer on and plucked note.  You may omit the plucked note.  Additionally, I often slide into the notes at the 5th fret, 4th string, such as those in measures 5, 11, 13, and 17 (sometimes more, sometimes less).\n\nThe style is Dock Boggs' 3-finger up picking.  The index finger plays the 2nd string, the middle finger plays the 1st string, and the thumb plays the 3rd, 4th, and 5th strings.  The melody is spread across the main strings, and the drone is used more sparingly.  The tuning is f#CGAD."

However, this tab was written such that one can play the entire tune without a capo. See the notes on the last page of the tab for more info.

I believe Don \"invented\" the unique tuning used for the song, g#EG#BC#, or open D (\"Reuben\") tuning up a whole step with the 1st string lowered. It's a fun, pretty simple & fairly easy banjo tune that is impressive. The \"Crazy Finger\" part is almost slap-your-self-in-the-forehead easy. But it sounds hard. I've also included most of the other variations Don does in the tune. Be sure to check out the original recording by Reno & Smiley; it's great! For the part where the banjo & the fiddle split the break, just barre @ the 12th for the E chord, 5th for the A chord, & 7th for the B chord, & it's thumb \u2014index/middle on the 3rd and 2nd/1st strings, played to the rhythm of the song. An excellent \"Jam\" tune. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

Most of it is bona fide though, I would say, with a melodic A part and single string B part. A great medium paced tune with lovely cascading melodies. Enjoy!"

As I remember the story, Monroe told Lamar Grier, his banjo player in the mid-1960s, \"This will be a good tune for you.\"  Grier reportedly did not like CtC, because it is played at a loping pace slower than most banjo instrumentals and does not employ any of the standard banjo rolls or licks.  Personally I think it better suited to the fiddle than the banjo or mandolin, but a good banjo player can still do an excellent job on it.  Butch Robins's arrangement in G minor tuning is simply outstanding, and I have tabbed out my interpretation of it.  Don't shy away from G minor tuning, which in my opinion works better with CtC than the major tuning. You will find that this is a haunting melody, and you can make it work for you (as Mr. Bill said)."

The tag after that section is my own.  It is worthwhile to incorporate backward rolls -- typically M-I-T with a first-string lead -- into your playing, because they add extra tension and interest, in my opinion."

The second substitutes a Bb chord for the D, to provide a kind of bluesy effect that is unexpected and punchy.  The third is one of my default licks, which I have used in a variety of tunes.  The fourth I have also used in many tunes, including \"Are You Missing Me,\" which you can hear on my BHO page, at http://www.banjohangout.org/myhangout/media-player/audio_player2.asp?musicid=9864&archived=    I have to tell you that for years I struggled with tabbing the correct timing on this one, and the solution came to me while I was sleeping -- I kid you not.  The last one is a wonderful Bill Emerson lick.  It is constructed beautifully, and I feel a sense of peace and oneness with the universe when I hear it.  Okay, perhaps that's overstating it somewhat.  But it is a great lick, which is anchored in the repetitive use of the C note, the flatted 7th, on the second string, with the melody notes doing a lovely walk up the first string."

There is two variants of the first part (part A): first a high version and then a lower version down the neck version. In the fiddle recording part A is the low part which start on the low notes (fourth string on the fiddle) and goes up, but to play all the notes I chose to go up one octave. In the variation I cheat away the low notes.\n2) Some kind of Scruggs style.\n3) Clawhammer\n\nChoose whatever style you like."

I have tabbed it in G, but you should capo up 2 to A (because it was written on the mandolin)."

As far as I know, Alan Munde\u2019s version included the first recorded low break to the tune, and the second break here is a low break I came up with, inspired by Munde's, that includes a bunch of tricks/licks I find myself using in a variety of different tunes."

It is a lovely medium-tempo tune, and my arrangement highlights the power of the pull-off on the first string out of the C position."

However, he unfortunately had to decline due to a \"health issue beyond his control.\" So, I thought I'd just learn a few of his tunes anyway. Why not start with one of the first ones that made him famous\u2026 the \"Devi's Dream\" and \"Sailor's Hornpipe\" medley from the \"Livin' On The Mountain\" album? This should be a note for note transcription, with the possible exception that there were a couple of spots where he may have used a \"pull-off\" lick getting to the A minor chord, but I couldn't really tell. I didn't include it, so the A minor bits are played around the 5th fret, instead of the first. I wish him well and hope that his health improves so that he might make it back in the future."

Although rather close to Ralph's break, neither of the breaks are replicas of his own; they are fully my own interpretations. He doesn't do the up the neck break, but I thought it was fun so I threw it in there. Has useful, standard key of \"G\" introduction & ending that can fit on many songs. Includes a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

It was not the first bluegrass concert at Carnegie Hall, having been preceded by Earl Taylor and the Stoney Mountain Boys, but it is certainly the most memorable.  Dig a Hole in the Meadow was one of the songs the Foggies played, and it incorporates one of Earl\u2019s most elegant breaks that nails the melody without over-reliance on formulaic rolls.  Ironically, Bill Monroe recorded the song as Darling Cory just 2 days before, on 6 December 1962, with Lonnie Hoppers playing a break similar but not identical to Earl\u2019s on banjo.  Most bluegrass folk are probably familiar with the version by the Foggies, but you should definitely give a listen to Monroe\u2019s version as well:  His singing is outstanding, Kenny Baker's fiddle playing is beautiful as always, and Monroe takes a mandolin break that is positively eerie."

Most of us are familiar with Jim and Jesse's 1950s recording of it, with Bobby Thompson playing a semi-melodic style on banjo.  The tablature is my own version of Dixie Hoedown, comprising two breaks.  The B Part in the second break is a bit tricky.  I was trying to find a way to play the half-step discord between the C and B notes in the B minor chord and between A# and A in the A minor chord.  I could find the discordant note on the fifth string, but could not play the other notes out of the minor chord on strings 1, 2, and 3 because my left hand could not accommodate the positions.  I hit upon playing from the chord position on strings 2, 3, and 4, with the discordant note on the fifth.  This works well, but it requires some practice.  If the text describing the B Part does not make sense to you, just use the MIDI function in TablEdit to play the tab, so that you can at least hear what it should sound like."

I learned this from a Joe Venuti and his Blue Six recording from '34, with some help from \"Joe Venuti and his Orchestra\"'s recording. It's a cool number with a not too complicated chord progression that moves right along. The bridge, IMHO, is wonderful, how it hangs on that Bb7 and is just dying to resolve. A good number to jam on. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

There are actually 2 different versions here, both adapted from the two versions in the \"Craig Duncan Master Fiddle Solo Collection\". The first version, a three part tune, is accommodating of the lower register of the banjo note-for-note in the first and second parts, although some \"octave switching\" is needed in the third part. The second version requires the use of the upper register of the banjo, and is much more difficult. It's not a jam standard, but a fun piece to play and should you come across a fiddler who knows either version, it's an excellent tune to play. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

The tab itself cannot accurately describe Jim's exceptional nuance and dynamics... you'll have to listen very closely to duplicate which notes sing out, and which notes are tucked into the background.\n      This afternoon I went through this tab with Jim to ensure it's accuracy.

        "desc": "Notes: I made this tab on a request for a clawhammer tab, but it includes three different versions. Down On The Corner is a difficult  clawhammer tune because of its calypso rhythm, three-finger style works much better. To get the calypso rhythm in clawhammer you must use some drop thumbs combined with \"skips\" (or air brushes), and emphasize the drop thumb notes. To get the calypso rhythm in 3-finger it is just to play a forward roll (T M t I M t I M - T for emphasize melody note played by thumb and t for thumb on fifth string)\n\nThe three versions I have tabbed are:\n\n1. First the basic riffs, as played on guitar (but it is played one octave lower on guitar). It is important to get the right rhythm when playing this. Count fast 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2 and the melody notes falls on the 1s.This can be played in any style.\n\n2. Then a clawhammer version where I have tried to get the calypso rhythm. Be sure to get the drop thumb and the skips (air brushes) right to keep the rhythm. Your hand shall be moving in a steady up and down motion as in most clawhammer tunes, but the emphasized drop thumbs and skips will get the calypso rhythm effects.\n\n3. And finally a three-finger version based on a simple forward roll. I think this is much easier than the clawhammer version because the forward roll fits into the calypso rhythm."

The thumb plays notes on the 3rd, 4th, and drone strings while the index and middle fingers play the 2nd and 1st strings, respectively.  My version follows Boggs' 1963 recording, where he plays the initial verse a little differently from the rest.  I have offered both ways in the tablature.  The tab here is a basic outline, but in actual practice many liberties may be taken and variations played.  I improvise a little when I play this, and I play with timing quite a bit, as Boggs often did.  The tuning is f#CGAD."

My arrangement is based in part on Butch Robins's recording and in part on an obscure tape of Bill Keith playing it in a jam at Roland White's house in 1968.  I have to warn you that it might be Vic Jordan playing banjo on the White tape, because he recorded a similar arrangement on his solo album a few years later.  However, to me it sounds like Keith's playing and Keith's banjo.  In any case, I tabbed it out in G, but to accommodate the fiddle and mandolin you would normally capo up 2 and play it in the key of A."

Same version of Schlange's, but in Guitar pro format (Mac friendlier), two options for pdf (with or without standard notation for printing options), and removed 24 measures (116 instead of 140) by using repeat signs and alternate ending notation. Less ink, paper, and page turning are always good in my book. Measures 86-89,110-111 add 5 to the fifth string unless it's zero (because it was originally in Tabledit format, tux guitar imported it that way to Guitar Pro and I'm unable to change it),Refer to the aforementioned sources for the MIDI, as it is the same."

You will note that I wrote the tab as though you are playing without Keith tuners and hence must fake the tuner part; if you have Keith or Scruggs tuners, by all means use them.  Note also that the chord structure of the first break is slightly different from the others:  In the A part, measure 8 (which is measure 7 if you ignore the introductory measure), the I chord (G) is held and leads into the V chord (D) in the next measure.  In all the other breaks, the equivalent of measure 7 is a II chord (A) that leads into the V chord (D).  Yep, that's the way Earl wrote, recorded, and played it."

The first break is the melody, fairly simple but just perfect. The second one is quite mind blowing and is really crazy. If you learn these breaks you can learn a lot about the Reno style. The first break is more of an Intermediate, fairly straightforward, but the second one is pretty hard. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

However, I don't know if Grandpa Jones ever played this on a Banjo, all the versions I have are on a guitar. Dave Hum plays a mean version (Scruggs Style) in A. Both Youtube versions are linked on the 1st page with lyrics. I've added a page 2 for the Chorus and a midi link (Dave Hum version in A) in case the Youtube links disappear. This is for the melody and back-up, there are other versions in Scruggs style available under the tabs menu. (I've put \"to Louisville\" in (paranthesis) because I live in Russellville, Arkansas and like to substitute \"to Russellville\" in my version when I play. Substitute your own 3 syllable town in your version, if you desire. Lou-is-ville, Russ-ell-ville, New-Or-leans, etc. Remember, Louisville is pronounced Louie-ville.

The pinches, sometimes straight, sometimes syncopated, serve as examples of combined intervallic-rhythmic variation.\n\nI have doubled the parts, also breaking them up into units of four measures each, indicated by a heavy bar line, putting in variations that sound good to me after all these years playing the tune.\n\nWithin the A and B sections, the order of parts can be moved around any way you want, but here I start with the simple before moving to the more complex.  One can go back to playing the tune\u2019s structure as AB, instead of doubling both sections.\n\nThe tune structure here is actually A1, A2, A3, A4; B1, B2, B3, B4.  These are not the only variations, obviously, but these are what I like to hear and play.  It\u2019s about playing the sounds that you want to hear, not about playing variations just to play them, or an abstract exercise.\n"

The key should not be as much a subject of worry as is the intense hand contortions needed to get the drop-C chord (e.g. 5567, 4th to 1st strings) sound in open-G; down the neck this is a real STRECH! It took me a looottt of practising to be able to make the chords up to speed, but it is worth it; it's a real neat sound. The other hard lick is the tag lick such as the one in measures 3 & 7. This one takes a little practice. The single string licks are mostly standard Reno single string licks, although there's one of my own at the beginning of the 5th break. This tune will definitely take some practice, but it's a real firecracker once you get it right. I shamelessly like this tune in Eb much better than drop-C tuning, key of C. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

Mack learned it from his great-uncle, Joe Blaylock (born 1854) who had worked at the mill in Trion, Georgia but was laid off and walked back home to Alabama. The original tune had two parts. James added the third part in the 1980\u2019s. Several musicians have since recorded it, a notable one being Chris Coole with Ivan Rosenburg on a CD in 2010 named \u201cFarewell Trion.\u201d (thanks to Janet Barton for history of this tune)\n\nHere's Janet Barton's tab and recording of the tune: http://www.banjohangout.org/archive/297439"

It is quite slow, and has a march-like quality (in rhythm, not melody!), which is slightly less exaggerated in the original recording by the use of sock-rhythm guitar rather than the standard bass-chord bluegrass/old time rhythm guitar. It's not particularly hard, and because it is slow the single string parts can (and should) be played by picking repeatedly with the thumb rather than TI or TIM (I have included right-hand fingering in this tab for this reason). There are a lot of bends in this tune, to replicate the many slides Smith used in the recording. I like to put a D-tuner on the low D, set the stop down to slightly above a C, and bend from the b7 up to the D in the second part, to replicate FA Smith's slide there. I highly recommend  listening to the original recording! Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

The tab is based on a transcription from the fiddle version in David Brody's The Fiddler's Fakebook. The first part is rather banjo friendly, but the second part contains some \"shuffling\" which can be played in several other ways on the banjo. Just use your own imagination and work out something own if you feel for it."

While not an unknown fiddle tune, it's not overly common and is one of my personal favorites. It's relatively hard, and I perpetually have trouble with the timing. There are two markedly different ways to play \"Fisher's\", one is at a medium tempo with a pronounced bounce, the other is at a relatively fast tempo with straight 8th notes. The former would be more of a dancing style, the latter a bluegrass style. There are two places in the tune which have a II7 (G7) chord, which may or may not be played by the guitarist. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

You will note that it anticipates the B part and that its chord structure is slightly different from the standard A part, in measures 1 to 9.\nBerline and the Dillards played it in D, and I transposed it to G.  I hope I captured the feel of his version."

(For simplicity I will refer just to Keith tuners.)  It is problematic to tab the Keith tuner changes in TablEdit, and so I have followed my usual practice:  I have tabbed the tune to show the melody notes without tuners (i.e., the notes as played on fretted strings 3 and 4), but I added the protocol for using Keith tuners on open strings (2 and 3) above the tab. So you can still play it if you do not have Keith tuners, although it sounds much better with the tuners.  The structure of the tune is AAB, and I have included a second version of the B part, this one up the neck.  Although similar to Huber's version, this is my own arrangement of Five in the Morning and not a note-for-note transcription of his."

The repetitive right-hand pattern is 4-2-1-2.  I have tabbed out an approximation of Stover's Staircase break here, and you can find a variation of the Staircase break in my tab to FMB elsewhere on BHO."

It's heavily syncopated and very striking: Reno accented a lot of melody notes on the offbeats, also brushing with his thumb, letting the banjo ring into the downbeat, and his staccato single-string work is legendary stuff, a bold stylistic departure from Earl's approach. This is one of Reno's signature tunes, perhaps his answer to Scruggs' 'Foggy Mountain Breakdown'. (See page 1 and 2.)"

These are the songs: St. Louis Blues (W.C. Handy), Pepper & Salt (Ralph Colicchio), Foochow's Shanghai (Christian Loos), The Savoy Rag (Pete Mandell), The Ghost Of The Banjo (Roy Smeck) & My Lady Jazz (A.J. Weidt). As a first impression of the book you can enjoy my composition Foochow's Shanghai.\n\nAs always you have a piano accompaniment on CD in three different speed levels.\n\nPlease visit: www.banjochrille.com\n\nContact: mail@banjochrille.com"

Tremolo on a classical guitar involves playing a rapid succession of index (i) - middle (m) - ring (a).  He pointed out that even though the combination of the notes is rapid each finger digit is only striking the string say twice a measure, or once a measure.  My theory is that if you increase the tempo on the index only to get the timing right on and then switch to middle only and then thumb only and then start mixing combinations of thumb + index only, or thumb + middle only, or index + middle only, then when you finally do thumb, index, middle you \"might\" be able to play a little faster than before."

B part is now complete with a \"C-Am7-D-G change, as opposed to C - - G, which is how the tab went until now.... :-)"

In the poem, Evangeline spends much of her life wandering North America in search of her lost love. The real Acadian exiles were also heartbroken from being forced from their homes."

I couldn't tab it out to play the slide at measure 3 exactly as I play it. What happens is you give the last note of measure 2 (3rd string, 2nd fret) its full eighth note count. Then, without picking again, you slide up to 4th fret on the 1 count of measure 3. The slide all happens on the 1 count and is done by the time you play the 2nd string open. So it's different from a bluegrass slide in that respect."

I first saw her in the 1990s when she was accompanist for Michele Shocked, and her reputation led me to a Michele Shocked concert in Victoria, B.C.  Brown lived up to expectations, and in the process I discovered the delightful Michele Shocked.  In addition to her progressive and jazz playing, Brown can rip off a straight-ahead bluegrass tune.  Girl\u2019s Breakdown is one of her originals that makes good use of Keith/Scruggs tuners, hence her clever play on the title \u201cEarl\u2019s Breakdown.\u201d  The tune is on her wonderful 2000 recording \u201cFair Weather.\u201d\n\nWhen examining the tab, you will be able to hear the note changes in the MIDI file -- and you will need to listen to the MIDI, to hear the tune's melody -- but these are not reflected in the frets indicated in the tab, which show the string going from 0 to 0.  This is because I employed the pitch change function to achieve that sound (also, how would TablEdit depict detuning the second string from B to A --- e.g., 0 to -2?).  The actual notes played are shown in text above the appropriate section of tab.  And I want to thank Jack Baker for alerting me to the pitch change function.  Through the years Jack has been generous and accommodating in helping me to understand the subtleties of TablEdit and of musical notation in general, and I gratefully acknowledge his guidance here.  His contributions to BHO have been very significant.\n\nOn the recording, Alison really burns it up; hence the MIDI is high-speed.  But you can slow the MIDI down, to hear it better.  And if you find the TablEdit file to be too long to print, with both musical notation and guitar accompaniment displayed, you can go into \u201cPrint Preview,\u201d then \u201cPrint Setup,\u201d then \u201cMultitrack\u201d to suppress the musical notation, and you can delete the guitar by clicking on the green bar above track 2 and deleting.\n\nThe structure of Girl\u2019s Breakdown is AAB.\n\nMichael\n"

Not traditional, but a great tune, and a challenge to play.\nThe song actually changes keys in the middle, from A to C. Also, there are many bars which have a time signature of 6/4 or 2/4, so the time on this song is a bit tricky.\nOther than that, pretty straightforward chords.\n\nEnjoy!\nArnon"

My version is in pretty straight melodic style.  The arrangement is difficult to play, but it is worth the effort because it is such a terrific tune.  If you are not familiar with it, be sure to play the MIDI file so that you can hear how the melody goes."

However, following Doc Watson's version, guitarists tend to play it in C, capoed up 2 to D. On the banjo the tune is also wonderful played out of open D tuning (f#DF#AD). Don Reno played it in D tuning, and he renamed it \"Green Mountain Hop.\" On his \"Something Auld\" album, over 30 years ago, Bill Keith also played \"Green Mountain Hop\" in open D tuning, and it is a great arrangement that I have tried to capture in this tablature. Pay particular attention to the interesting variation on the V chord (A) beginning in measure 28 -- for me, this clever sequence typifies Bill Keith's inventive playing. I have also thrown in a single-string version of the first part of the tune, for a slightly different approach."

For one, the B part in the first break is to my ears (but what do I know) perhaps more faithful to Scruggs\u2019s recording on the Foggy Mountain Banjo album than most other versions, all due to the difference made by one note, the second string B rather than the first string D.  In other words, following the Flint Hill Flash's lead, I hear Scruggs's first pinch as involving the open second (B) string and the third string at the second fret, rather than the open first (D) string and the third string at the second fret.  For another, the second break starts out high but is mostly down the neck, in melodic style (hah, take that, Flint Hill Flash!).  It\u2019s a tasteful version, if I do say so myself.  The third break has some ideas you may find useful, and the ending is of general interest and utility.  It\u2019s an ending lick I first heard J. D. Crowe play."

The first time through is very easy, all played out of the drop-C tuning open C chord, and only one left hand ornament, a simple choke. All forward rolls. The second time through is more of an intermediate/advanced version using hammer-ons, pull-offs, and more difficult chokes as well as more varied rolls. This is in the style of banjo & fiddle. Has a mandolin melody track. Have fun!"

        "desc": "Notes: The Don Reno banjo instrumental \"Hen Scratchin' Stomp\". It's sort of Don's take on Katy Hill, with the second section in E instead of G. As in the 1949 Mercury recording of \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" by Flatt & Scruggs, the banjo plays in E minor while the backup band plays in E major. Creates a cool effect. This is a good start to learning Don's rolls, & to see where he differs from the Scruggs style even in its basic rolls. Not too hard, & an altogether fun piece to play. Try bringing it out at your next jam; very few people know it, but it's a simple tune & the others will pick it up quickly. I highly recommend listening to the Tennessee Cut-Ups original recording. It's full of energy, drive, & will give you a good idea of Don's timing."

The banjo melody is an octave down from the fiddle, and I've changed the melody where it would go too low for the banjo. I've left the contest variations in, so it makes quite an interesting banjo piece. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

The form is AABB, ending with the first part (AA). E.G., you're at a jam, the fiddle plays AABB, the mandolin plays AABB, the banjo plays AABB, and the fiddle plays AABBAA, end of tune. This is a nice smooth piece, and fortunately it's not too hard to get the real smoothness. There is some \"cross-picking\" (crossing one right-hand finger over another), and some dropping the middle finger inside. The A section is in Bb & the B section is in F. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

Make liberal use of on-the-beat slides on some of the melody notes, as if playing this on a fretless banjo.  I learned the tune from an Art Rosenbaum recording, where he plays it in clawhammer style."

I first heard Bill Keith play something close to this back in the 1960s and much later heard Bobby Thompson play a version on the famous front-porch tape that Steve Arkin and Keith made of Thompson in 1964 or so.  There are no standard 3-finger rolls in this piece, and undoubtedly there are different (and probably better) ways of playing the same notes.  But this is what I came up with, and it seems to work, although it is tough to play."

Instead, he played most of the break in single-string style.  It is exceedingly simple and stunningly effective.  The song is in waltz time, with the capo on the first fret -- or perhaps Flatt and Scruggs tuned up their instruments a half step, as they tended to do in their earlier recordings.  And, yes, the break comprises only 4 measures (thanks to Ken for asking!)."

The tune itself seems to be an old-time version of the ragtime tune of the same name, the latter credited to Lew Sully.  The ragtime song has appallingly racist lyrics, incidentally, which is perhaps not surprising given the era in which it was written.  In any case, the instrumental version of \"I Don't Love Nobody\" is a wonderful Scruggs-style tune, and this is my version of it in the key of G.  My version is based on Allen Shelton's, but includes some variations that you might find useful."

If you want to hear how it sounds, you can listen to my mp3, where I am playing with a capo on the first fret, and my 5th string tuned to g#.  I hope the tab isn't confusing, but it should get you playing the song! Enjoy..."

The break contains ones of Shelton's signature licks, in measure 13, and it illustrates his renowned bouncy style, as can be seen in measures 4 through 7.  If you listen to the original recording by Jim and Jesse, you will hear lots of Shelton's tasty backup, including licks influenced by the pedal steel, which also show up in Bill Keith's playing.  Jim and Jesse recorded it in the key of B, and so my tab is in B."

Of relevance to BHO, Bill Keith was the banjo player of the day in the Blue Grass Boys.  Several concert recordings of Keith's version with Monroe are floating around, and I have combined 2 of his breaks to give you a feel for his approach to the tune.  Pay particular attention to measures 14 through 17, where Keith dishes out a tasty melodic take on the A (II) to D (V) chords, a section that alone is worth the price of admission."

Being a cooperative person, I posted a recent version of mine, and this is the tablature for it, more or less.  My version incorporates a little bit of a salute to the mystery player we have all agonized about -- and if you saw the video of Earl playing \"I'll Fly Away\" at Nat Winston's, you will probably agree that the mystery player on the tape is indeed Earl Scruggs. Also, near the end, it includes a tip of the hat to Bill Keith."

It's a simplified variation of the tab by David Marshall located @ http://www.hangoutstorage.com/banjohangout.org/storage/tabs/i/tab-ill-fly-away-11989-211438102009.jpg\nwhich he tabbed in Double C (Double D with capo). I've also included a link to the \"Oh Brother\" version in D that can be played along with to get the timing and melody, and added a page 2 for the measure pattern to play and the complete lyrics.\nI will attach this to the Gospel Lover's group and Beginner Clawhammer group."

The tab is my version and comprises two breaks.  The first break is down the neck and is the melody of the verse, which is the standard way of playing the song.  The second break starts out up the neck, with the melody of the verse, and then goes down the neck for the melody of the chorus.  I first worked this version out in the 1970s and still play it this way.  I guess I am not very imaginative."

The first sticks pretty close to the melody; the second departs a bit and includes some licks that you might find useful in a variety of tunes.  If you go to the Music section on my BHO web page, you will find a track of this song, from a practice tape by my band Silver Spring, recorded in Vancouver, B.C., in the mid-1970s.  The second break in the tablature is the one on the track.  On the recording, we played in A; so just capo up 2 and play it as tabbed in G.  Note that the last D chord is a bit tricky, because it involves alternating the index and middle fingers while picking the first string.  Although difficult, the lick is worth mastering, because you can use it in lots of tunes.  The melody in the lick is played on the first string and involves a descending melodic sequence (D --> C --> B --> A --> G) embedded in a repetitive rhythmic pattern, as follows, with the melody string IN CAPITALS:  ONE--three--two--one--ONE--three--two-one---ONE-three--two--one, and so on."

Also, it's labelled jazz, but it's really a Jazz tune arranged for bluegrass banjo; the chords are authentic though. Taken from Django Reinhardt, Stephane Grappelli, & the Hot Club de France's movie from 1939. The ending is played by planting the heel of the right hand behind (above) the strings, & brushing upward in rapid succession (eight notes) with the index & middle fingers; this is hard, but definitely doable with practice. The Django-style run can be played with thumb & index up to a certain speed, and can probably be played at faster speeds with all three fingers though I do not play this way. Have fun!"

Some of these breaks here are based on some of his breaks, and some are my own. Due to the tempo, single string work, and some very quick changing of positions this is quite a difficult piece. Single string work is TITI. It's labled Open G (gDGBD), but it has the 5th capoed up 2 (at the 7th fret) for aDGBD, in the key of D. Also, it's labeled \"scruggs\", but it's really \"Reno\" style. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

While watching TV and goofing around with this tune, I was trying to come up with some way to vary the \"bum ditty\" to keep the arrangement from sounding repetitive.  I stumbled on the idea of playing the \"ditty\" using two quarter notes instead of two eight notes.  The first half of this song is done with the usual \"bum ditty,\" but the second half uses the two-quarter-note \"bum ditty\" wherever the word \"me\" occurs in the lyrics.   These are all half notes or dotted half-notes in the melody, and a great place for a slower rhythm.  I'm sure this is an old idea in clawhammer, but it's new to me.  I hope you enjoy it."

Well, there is a little bit of that theme, but it's not as strong as I suspected it would be, but it's a fun jig to play in any case. Fingering for jigs is always \"M-something-M M somthing-M\", where that something is a hammer-on, a pull-off, or a drop-thumb. If there are exceptions I indicate it. In this tune there are two up-picks and two measures that have M-M-M M-M-M. Other than that, pretty easy to play. Oh, the source was \"The Dance Music of Ireland, O'Neill's 1001\", number 206.

Matt believes it was written in New York by an expat Irishman, but has been unable to find absolute confirmation of its origin. The move G to Bm is fairly unusual in Irish music. Nice tune, rocks along quite well. I have uploaded the TablEdit file as well as the straight notation for the benefit of fiddle players(pdf) and the tab & chords in pdf also."

Alan Munde also a very interesting version that Lee Marcus has provided a tablature for on BHO.  My version is in good ole G tuning, the default tuning of bluegrass banjo.  I have included 4 breaks.   The B part on several of them is challenging and will require some work.  Altogether, there is probably more variation here than I would use on stage or in a jam, and I include it just to show you the possibilities.  One aspect to note is that melody notes on the high break (# 3) are played on the first string with the middle finger.  This may seem counter-intuitive, but it works."

I have fairly small hands, and this is the only way I can get the necessary volume on the high bs, but you might be able to do a hammer-on with your pinky for a more consistent melodic clawhammer style.I see that O'Neil's Music of Ireland (the 1850 melodies one) has a version, number 1437, that has some grace notes, tripplets, and \"c\"s raised to \"c#s\". I haven't explored that one yet... We'll see what happens..."

Both banjo breaks are included along with the backup for the mandolin and fiddle. In other words, the tab is written such that you can follow along with the recording. Chords are notional, i.e. not necessarily exactly what the banjo is playing at any given moment, but what I think the basic chords are for the general tune, for each bar. Adjust settings so that chords are displayed as letter names only. Also, this tab is intended to be displayed at 4 bars per line. I just found out yesterday, from my Dad, that Bill Keith had died the day before. I wish I had a recording to upload instead, but this is the best I can do for now, to honor one of the great pillars of modern banjo music and technique."

It worked out so well (I think...) that I decided to get the pay copy of TableEdit, do a real nice version and post it here.  It's fairly easy and straightforward except you can't really do phantom hammers in TablEdit that I know of so in the few spots where it looks like there is some drop thumb, just play them as phantom hammer-ons instead.  Of course, you can probably drop thumb these parts, too, if you like."

Transcription is from a slowed version of the song from Rhonda Vincent and the Rage's \"Ragin' Live\" album. I believe the first 29 measures or so are a reasonably accurate reflection of what Kenny Ingram played during the kick and first verse. I am less confident in the B part (starting at measure 30); there was a lot of artifact in the original recording I was working from and while the banjo in the recording is still providing pulse it's a little hard to hear all the subtleties under the harmony vocals."

According to the story, when Yvon was young he walked across the farmyard and was attacked by the old rooster. Yvon, with injured leg and pride, pulls out his sling-shot and faces the rooster. As the beast turns its head sideways to look him in the eye \u2014 roosters turn sideways for a face to face \u2014 Yvon takes a shot. The bird, hit in the head, falls to the ground. Yvon, after making sure nobody saw him, leans it against a fence where he can discretely keep an eye on it. After a while, the rooster, who was only knocked out, gets up and staggers back to the henhouse, to the relief of Yvon. The next morning, as usual, the old rooster hopped on a fence to wake up the whole farm, but he was now singing out of tune."

I originally thought it was a Cajun tune, as I first heard it by Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys on their fantastic album \"Trace of Time\". This arrangement is a transcription (more or less) of Dave Greeley's 1st fiddle solo from that recording. It's not terrifically easy but is attainable - and it sounds great when you get it up and running! Have fun."

Three things to note about my arrangement:  First, the break opens and closes with a vamp pattern.  The song is a standard number on the accordion (\"Turn off the bubble-a machine-a!\"), and it just sounded more complete to me with a cheesy intro and exit.  Second, I am playing F chord notes against the first D minor chord; hence it becomes a D minor 7th.  Again, it just sounded right to me at the time, and still does.  Third, the V chord -- i.e., G -- progresses to a G augmented.  If you're going to go cheesy you might as well go whole hog (if I might mix my metaphors).  So put on your dancing shoes, strap on the old accordion, and everybody polka."

Perhaps the only tricky bit is found in measures 10 and 26, and I have indicated the right-hand picking pattern, which involves playing the 2nd string with the thumb and then crossing over and playing the 3rd string with the index finger, a pattern than Alan Munde occasionally uses (at least to my ear) to good effect."

Has a bluegrass guitar rhythm track & a bass rhythm track. The rolling parts aren't that hard, actually, but the single string can be a little tricky. The double stops are played by brushing down on the strings with your thumb."

At some point, I decided that the Olentangy, the smaller of the Columbus' two rivers (they join near downtown) deserved its own tune, so I made up this one, Little Olentangy (Composed on the fiddle by Chuck Levy \u00a9 2006, arranged for the banjo \u00a9 2012).  According to Wikipedia, the river now known as the Olentangy was originally known as the \"Keenhongsheconsepung\" which literally translated as \"stone for your knife stream\" based on the shale found along its shore. Early settlers translated this to \"Whetsone River\". In 1833, the Ohio General assembly passed legislation intending to restore the original native American names to some Ohio waterways, but mistakenly gave Whetstone River the name \"Olentangy\", Delaware for \"river of red face paint\" which had actually belonged to the river that is now known as Big Darby Creek.  Little Olentangy appears on Scratching and Clawing, my first CD, on Red Dog Records, 2006.\n\nI am playing clawhammer style, on a Bart Reiter banjo.  The pot is an old Vega Tubaphone, with a new 5-string neck."

The tuning is aEAC#E or standard G tuning gDGBD with capo on 2nd fret (and fifth string tuned up to a or spiked/capoed at the 7th fret)."

I went in search of a TAB to help me learn it and eventually pieced together a version, just ever-so slightly different from his wonderful version.\n\nIt evolves each time I play it, but it's very catchy.  This is my latest incarnation (but one - changed the b-part to be more like the Silas one).  I believe the original writer to be Michael Fox, but correct me if I'm wrong!"

Note also that the trick in the first IV (C) chord of the third break is to emphasize the alternation between the first string 2nd fret and first string open -- this alternation is the effect I am trying to achieve.  I highlighted this in the MIDI by selecting \"ringing note\" for those notes."

Massive public demand for an arrangement of this tune certainly was not the reason... ;)"

You may play scales on single strings.  However, that doesn't have much practical application for bluegrass playing.  The idea is to play rolls, so, I believe scales should be practiced that way.  Here is the simple rule to follow:  never play the same string twice in a row; never use the same finger twice in a row."

In those few cases, I moved those parts to the open position, making sure simultaneously, that they 'fit in' with what preceeded and followed those sections, for smooth playing throughout...\n\nI also found that the addition of a few hammers and pull-offs (slurs) made certain passages flow better, so I added those...\n\nI could never have figured this tune out by ear alone, so Rick Diesel's copy from a guitar original helped get us on the road and on the right path...\n\nThe rest fell on my 40+ years experience playing guitar, reading music, transcribing experience and finally banjo playing ability...\n\nAnd being very familiar with Tony's amazing musical senses and guitar playing abilities...\n\nI genuinely hope this now Tabledited piece helps the folks who seek it out...\n\nMartinLuther1960"

Mark recorded Marching Through Georgia with Emory Lester for the CD, Acoustic Rising, released on the Mountain Home label in 2006.  On the CD, Mark told me, he placed a capo on the 5th fret of his banjo tuned in double C (gCGCD) raising the banjo's pitch to the key of F. To make my job of transcribing this tune into tab easier, I asked Mark to play without the capo."

Steve Arkin has stated that Bill Keith had an arrangement of the song in the early 1960s, although I have never heard Keith\u2019s version (and would love to, if anybody has a recording).   In any case, several years ago I finally worked up an arrangement of my own, and I just got around to the tablature, posted here.  It took me about one month to tab it out \u2013 a real pain \u2013 but I think I finally got it close to right.  I borrowed the idea for the ending from an excellent tab by Jack Gentle Jr. (aka MickG) that was posted in the Tab Archive some years ago, and I gratefully acknowledge it here.  When you work through the tab, you will find unusual D13 and D7 chord positions in measure 24 and elsewhere.  Here I made use of Sonny Osborne\u2019s brilliant creation of a pedal steel\u2013like chord progression that he demonstrates in his Homespun Tapes video."

You do need to know how to move around up the neck with your basic closed chord forms, and it helps if you are a soft-hearted old goat, like the OP and I.  I based the back-up very loosely on what the piano and guitar are doing on the video that was posted in the request thread."

All lead breaks and backup are included. One item of interest is that, several times in this tune, Earl employs a pretty wicked lick that covers 3 chord positions (inversions of the same chord) to go from a I7 chord to a IV chord, and from a V7 chord to a I chord. You have to jump all over the neck to play it, and the distance your hand has to jump changes significantly, depending which transition you are playing, because the notes are much more closely spaced in the upper part of the neck, than in the lower part. It tends to foil muscle memory. The tab is written such that you can follow along with the recording. Adjust settings so that chords are displayed as letter names only and tab is displayed at 4 bars per line. The blank 3 measures preceding each verse are skipped when the tab is played with the MIDI player, using the Reading List tool. They are only there to maintain the chord pattern such that each verse starts at the beginning of a line."

The titles create confusion since there are two main branches in Old Time and further regional, local and bluegrass variants. The A Part is pretty close in most versions with one noticeable variation \u2013 either dipping down to an A-note or rising up to F# in the second and sixth measures. This variation is found in both Old Time and Bluegrass versions and a G chord is sometimes played in these spots. It\u2019s in the B Part (fifth and sixth measures) where the melodic contour branches in one of two directions \u2013 either dipping down from the fifth (A) to the tonic (D)/D chord, or, as Paul Warren played it (New Five Cents), using a G-note double-stop with a B-note)/G chord, then up to an A-note/A chord and moving upwards happily in major second intervals. Many (but not all) Old Time versions (\u2018New Five Cents\u2019, \u2018Ruffled Drawers\u2019 or \u2018Buffalo Nickel\u2019) tend to keep dipping down to the low D-note/D chord and use fewer chords than Bluegrass versions which are based on Paul Warren\u2019s version."

This is one I decided to tab from a slow session that I play in. I believe I found a new purpose for this polka when it comes to banjo playing. This polka could be renamed \"A Study in Alternate String Pull-Offs\". Working on technique can be quite boring, but when you have a little tune behind it it becomes fun again. Almost every measure of this piece can be played with one or two alternate string pull-offs. If you have your hand is in first position, then you will practice the alternate string pull-off with your index finger. If you shift to the second position, then the alternate string pull offs are now down with the middle finger. So, play this tune to get a work-out and practice your alternate string pull-off technique! Have fun!"

I did this as an exercise because people on the BHO keep telling us beginners that transcribing recordings teaches a lot (haven't noted much of a change yet... ;).\n\nI chose \"No Title Yet Blues\" because I like it a lot and there are few tabs of it to be found. This is the 1st break from the Alan Munde recording, unfortunately I haven't got the original Weissberg/Brickman recording (I'd love to get that and the the other recording from the \"New Dimensions\" that aren't on the \"Deliverance\" soundtrack, if anyone knows where to find them...).\n\nThe tuning turned out to be a D tuning with the 4th string dropped by a minor third to a B note.\n\nI wish I could play this tune well. Before this I had never played anything in D tuning (just got my banjo 8 months ago) so this will take me some time to play reasonably well...\n\nThe tab was written using a free linux tab editor called songwrite2. Unfortunately it is still a very simple program which is why I couldn't add most of the embellishments."

There is really one banjo break which is played then repeated after the guitar and fiddle solos with minor changes to the first break. So play through once, let your buddies take breaks and do it all again or improv on the 2nd break (that's what I do). Have fun. Here's the audio source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqYaIqQ3VYI"

I resumed working on some ideas I had been fooling with on the banjo and tried to capture the feel of the Lights, ending up with the tune I have tabbed out here.  The ascending run of triplets was an attempt to convey the sense of the shimmering and rippling of the Lights.  Note that the timing gets a little bit funky toward the end of the A part, but it works.  A few years ago, with my band Knee Deep, I debuted the tune at, fittingly enough, the Northern Lights Bluegrass and Old-Time Music Festival here in Saskatchewan."

You can hear it on youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJYiixdCN0w) or on my hangout page.  Write me if you have any questions."

Cappeau, a wine merchant and poet, had been asked by a parish priest to write a Christmas poem. Unitarian minister John Sullivan Dwight, editor of Dwight's Journal of Music, created a singing edition based on Cappeau's French text in 1855.\n\nIt is also very popular in Sweden, and when making this arrangement I listened a lot to an old recording by the old Swedish tenor singer Jussi Bj\u00f6rling."

From what I've read it's based on a Revolutionary War piece entitled \"Welcome Here Again\".  This has been transcribed from the key of D to G to better utilize standard banjo tuning. The large Roman numerals alert the player to fretboard position while the smaller numerals directly above the tab suggest left hand fingering.  Right hand fingering is suggested as \"t\",\"i\",\"m\".\n"

I have tabbed my interpretation of Earl Scruggs's break and of J. D. Crowe's break (with the BGAB).  Scruggs's break shows his genius for capturing the melody without always relying on cliched licks or rolls.  Crowe's break is derived from Scruggs's, but departs from it in subtle ways.  Both are worth learning."

The first break is similar to what Bill Keith, Eric Weissberg, and others played in the 1960s and contains that OJC run useful in so many tunes.  The second break is more the way I play it today, with lots of drive coming from forward rolls (in Bill Keith's terminology; I used to call it \"walking up the strings\").  Either version is worth adding to your arsenal."

My friends say that this particular harmony part has the flavor of the Middle East; so maybe it should be called \"Mediterranean OJC.\"  Whatever you call it, the harmony part is fun to play, and you will be able to come up with plenty of variations as you work it."

You can find numerous versions on youtube, including nice recordings by Slim Whitman and by Jimmy Wakely that provide a clear roadmap of the melody.  I first heard it played on the 5-string by Jeremy Stephens in a video of 5 prewar Gibsons in Chris Cioffi\u2019s shop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovfiyOPEvPI  His playing inspired me to work up my own version, and I borrowed several of his ideas, particularly in the up-the-neck B part."

There are several versions of Jingle Bells posted, but none as the original title, so here it is. Simplify or get fancy as you see fit. I've posted the Richard Hefner link for now, I will post to my website when it becomes available. Linked to the Christmas Corner and Beginner Clawhammer groups."

Feel free to change the rolls, as well as the filll-in licks/walking bass connecting parts (anyway, the vocal version has shorter connection between the words in the first part - adjust the number of walking bass measures by yourself).\nThis is just one of possible versions how to play the melody in the first part and how to roll the harmony in the second part. The third part (also in the concert key of A, played thanks to capo in G) is missing but you are supposed to play some fill-in lick under the fiddle or harmonica solo - find them e.g. at http://banjosessions.com/?p=109 .\nThe melody over the dominant A chord (concert B chord) in the first part is compromised - however if you have big hands, you can reach the actual melody note on the 6th fret (counted with capo) with your pinky while holding the barre with your index finger on the 2nd fret."

Earl did not play a high break), and the third break includes some melodic stuff that lets you keep the drive going while improvising a bit.  Note that I am using Flatt and Scruggs's chord progression, where the 1 chord (G) and then the 5 chord (D) are played in measures 7 and 8, respectively.  Monroe's original version held the 1 chord (G) in both measures 7 and 8, although he later played it with a 7 chord (F) and then 5 chord (D) in measures 7 and 8, respectively.  I prefer Flatt and Scruggs's version, which is mid-way in complexity between Monroe's original stripped-down version and his later one.  Although I have tabbed it out in the key of G, you would normally capo up 2 to play it in A."

Named for president Woodrow Wilson, Douglas was born in 1922 on a farm in rural Clay County in an area known as Rush Fork. I did not know Wilson well, but did get to encounter him a few times.   He had a fierce feeling and passion for old-time music that was moving and inspiring.  Wilson Died at age 76 in 1999.\n\nWilson recorded \"Pretty Little Cat\" on \"Fiddle Tunes from Central West Virginia\", with fine accompaniment of Kim Johnson on banjo and Mark Payne on guitar.  Wilson's version has only one A and one B part.  Lee Triplett, an older Clay County fiddler played a different melody that he called Pretty Little Cat.\n"

I have tabbed it in G, but you should capo up 2 to A (because it was written on the mandolin)."

I spent about 2 hours trying to get the tuning and the basic chords right, then about 5-7 hours actually writing it down....then about 1-2 hours going through it over and over and over again trying to make sure that it sounds ok. The only problem of mine would be that I just could not for the life of me figure out how to make using the computer so i did it the old fashion way, everyone else's tabs look MUCH neater then mine does but i don't care, personally.  I'm just glad i am able to share it with you guys.  Hope it sounds okay and thanks so much to anyone using it, it honestly means so much!!! :) xx\n\nNOTE: This is based of of Taylor Swift's 'Red (Original Demo Recording)' that can be found on her RED Deluxe Edition CD.  They are similar, but have some differences, mainly that this one sounds more country (in my personal opinion)\n\nTuning Open-G, Lowered 5th string, PLAY WITH CAPO on 4 (without using a capo on the 5th string).  I have found that i have to re-tune just a little when i put on the capo.  When you have the capo on the tuning will be f#F#BEbF#"

The first is my attempt to capture the melody in standard \"Scruggs\" style (i.e., North Carolina three-finger style), with a few melodic riffs thrown in.  The second is a more frankly melodic break.  Lots of stuff here you can use in other tunes as well."

The first break is pretty straight Scruggs style, whereas the second break is more improvisational."

It later got some new life breathed into it when he rearranged it in the late-1970s and recorded it as 'White Russia' on the self-titled album 'The Dirt Band'.  Later still it resurfaced once more in what we know today as 'Return to Dismal Swamp'.  In my tab I've incorporated all the known versions of this song into one arrangement.  It's a great banjo tune from the mind of John McEuen and it's worthy of your interest."

There are similar, single solo, tabs in Tony Trischka's books \"Melodic Banjo\" and \"Bill Keith Banjo,\" that certainly have enough info to play the tune similar to the way Bill did it. However, for those of you who are interested in all of the specific details, (or just can't stand it when the books leave them out) this should be exactly how Bill played it on the record. The tab is written such that you can follow along with the recording. Adjust settings so that chords are displayed as letter names only, and tab is displayed at 4 bars per line."

Anyway, the banjo break combines Scruggs style with melodic sequences, which are necessary if you have any hope of capturing the melody.  In addition, melodic sequences are worth playing for their own sake, and I regret that they seem to have fallen out of favor with many current banjo players.  I have included two versions of the B part, a low break and a high break.  I play it either way, although the version low on the neck is easier when the stage is dark (and I can't see where the positions are higher up on the neck).  To accommodate the fiddle, the tune is played in A, with the banjo capoed up 2."

        "desc": "Notes: This version of Rocky Road to Dublin comes from Fiddler Wilson Douglas of Clay County West Virginia. Wilson was born in 1922 on a farm in rural Clay County in an area known as Rush Fork.  Sometime in the early 1980\u2019s, Kate Brett and I decided to visit some older players in West Virginia.  We were looking for Wilson, and happened to stumble upon David Morris, who arranged a meeting.  I did not know Wilson well, but he had a fierce feeling and a deep passion for old-time music that was moving and inspiring.  Wilson Died at age 76 in 1999.\n\nWilson recorded \u201cRocky Road to Dublin\u201d on \u201cThe Right Hand Fork of Rush\u2019s Creek\u201d, Rounder Records 0047, recorded and produced by Guthrie T. Meade and Mark Wilson, 1975 , re-released on CD in 2005.  Wilson plays this tune in the key of G on the recording.  When I worked it out on the fiddle, it seemed to fit best with the fiddle tuned \u201cGDgd\u201d.\n\nThe album notes say this:  \u2018The title has been used for at least one jig and a polka, presumably referring to the Irish city.  Wilson says, \u201cthat tune was composed about Dublin, Virginia.  That was the only trail at that time through Virginia and they named the town Dublin\u201d\u2019.\n\nWilson\u2019s recording actually starts on what I would call a fragment of the \u201cB\u201d part, and then goes to the \u201cC\u201d part, before going to the \u201cA\u201d part. (The tune ends on the \u201cC\u201d part).  I have recorded the tune with the \u201cA\u201d part first, the \u201cB\u201d part second, and the \u201cC\u201d part third.  The \u201cA\u201d and \u201cC\u201d parts repeat, but the \u201cB\u201d part is only played once.\n\nTowards the end of the recording, Wilson plays a variation on the \u201cA\u201d part.  The first time I play through the tune, I play it straight, but the second time through, I play the \u201cA\u201d variation.  For variety, I created some up-the-neck variations for the third time through before returning to the theme the last time around.\n\nNote that an \u201cR\u201d in the tab indicates a roll (Galax Lick), and \u201c()\u201d in the tab means the note is to be played quietly or may be skipped entirely, at the discretion of the banjoist.\n\nAllen Sisson recorded an entirely different melody titled \u201cRocky Road to Dublin\u201d.  Another version comes from Clyde Davenport.\n"

The titles create confusion since there are two main branches in Old Time and further regional, local and bluegrass variants. The A Part is pretty close in most versions with one noticeable variation \u2013 either dipping down to an A-note or rising up to F# in the second and sixth measures. This variation is found in both Old Time and Bluegrass versions and a G chord is sometimes played in these spots. It\u2019s in the B Part (fifth and sixth measures) where the melodic contour branches in one of two directions \u2013 either dipping down from the fifth (A) to the tonic (D)/D chord, or, as Paul Warren played it (New Five Cents), using a G-note double-stop with a B-note)/G chord, then up to an A-note/A chord and moving upwards happily in major second intervals. Many (but not all) Old Time versions (\u2018New Five Cents\u2019, \u2018Ruffled Drawers\u2019 or \u2018Buffalo Nickel\u2019) tend to keep dipping down to the low D-note/D chord and use fewer chords than Bluegrass versions which are based on Paul Warren\u2019s version."

The right hand in the high part is a bit tricky, involving using the middle finger on the second string in a kind of repetitive inside roll like this:  5-3-2-5-1-2-3-1"

I asked a colleague who is a first violinist for a symphony orchestra and he thought it was a Scottish dance but didn't know the name either. Try googling a melody... Anyway, I eventually found out that the tune was called \"Sailor's Hornpipe\" or \"The College Hornpipe\" and in fact is a very popular fiddle tune. I guess I should feel stupid for not knowing..."

The banjo is tuned to G minor tuning [GDGBbD] and played with the capo on the second fret. The first three parts are in A minor and the fourth part is in D minor. Have fun!!"

My tab is not a reproduction of Earl Scruggs\u2019s classic version on banjo, which BTW is very similar to Snuffy Jenkins\u2019s earlier version.   However, in the tab you will hear the influences of banjoists such as Earl Scruggs, Bill Keith, Alan Munde, and Butch Robins, as well as Byron Berline\u2019s arrangement on fiddle.  The tune is played in the key of A.  The chord progression is simple:  Although you could hold the I chord (A) throughout, it is typically played with a fast turnaround to the V chord (E), and I have tabbed it that way.  I hear 3 parts to Sally Goodin\u2019, although Berline\u2019s version includes a fourth part, a transition to the relative minor (F#m) that I have not included here."

This is mountain minor tuning capoed up two frets to match the fiddle. It's a departure for me since I normally arrange Irish tunes so I can play them at sessions, but I love old-timey music too. I don't think I had to change much for the banjo other than notate in cut-time instead of 2/4. Oh, and here is a cool link with the fiddler playing the tune. http://slippery-hill.com/RP/008-Sally.mp3\nCheers!"

The second break starts with a semi-melodic segment reminiscent of Allen Shelton's wonderful break on the recording of the song by Jim and Jesse, and the second segment incorporates elements (but is not a faithful copy) of Bill Keith's jaw-dropping break on his album \"Living on the Mountain\" with Jim Rooney, released in 1964 or thereabouts.  If you haven't heard the album, you should grab a copy to hear marvelous banjoistics by a young Bill Keith.  As to the melody of Salty Dog, you might ask what a C note is doing in an E chord. Perhaps the simplest answer is to think of E augmented.  As to the perennial question \"What is a salty dog anyway?\", I will stay out of this one.  Either it's a soft drink, or it's a pickled sausage, or it's something else altogether."

I became familiar with the tune from a tab that Don Borchelt posted on his web page (http://www.banjr.com/tablatures.htm) some time ago, and I have since encountered it in jams.  The version I have posted here is very much for the bluegrass banjo, with both Scruggs-ish and melodic elements."

Neil Rosenberg and Charles Wolfe's discography of Monroe states that Monroe learned a version of the tune from an old-time fiddler who lived in southern Indiana/northern Kentucky.  It is close to the tune \"I Don't Love Nobody,\" and you can find versions of the latter in the BHO tab archive."

I had an \"Ah, hah!\" moment when I realized that my high break used no open strings and didn't involve the 5th string. This arrangement, while pretty simple is totally moveable up and down the neck so you can play in Am, Bm, Cm, Dm, Em, etc. It's in Tabledit and pdf. I sometimes do a hammer-on as opposed to a slide for the first measure as it bluegrasses it up a bit. If that's too hard just start on 3rd string 7 fret."

He recorded it with Bill Keith on banjo in 1963, the version most of us are familiar with.  However, there is a radio tape of Monroe playing on the Opry Jamboree from December 1958, with Joe Drumright on banjo, and rumor has it that Monroe had to phone Drumright to play it over the phone to teach it to Keith just before they recorded it in 63.  A concert tape from 1977 of the Blue Grass Boys with Bill Holden playing a marvelous version on banjo is also floating around.  (Apparently by then Monroe had discarded his dictum that there can be only one guy named Bill in the BGB).  My arrangement comprises three breaks and incorporates elements from these different players.  The first break is loosely based on Bill Keith's recorded version with Monroe.  The second break is a nifty melodic arrangement that is my version of the way Bill Holden played it.  The third break is from a 1981 concert recording of Bill Keith, in which he introduced another outstanding take on the tune.  Capo up 2 and play it in A."

This arrangement is a simple adaptation for 3 finger style banjo from the version played by Bruce Molsky, Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas, Phil Cunningham, Russ Barenberg et al at the 'Transatlantic Sessions 4' at Celtic Connections in Feb 2009. It has a mixture of single string and melodic styles. I hope you enjoy it!"

The first is a straightforward version of the tune that establishes the melody.  Although it is by no means in Reno's inimitable style, it does include several licks reminiscent of his picking.  The B part is built around a D lick from the playing of another of my favorite pickers, the great Don Stover.  If you can grab this lick, you will find it useful in all sorts of tunes.  The second break is considerably more interpretive, with some melodic and other elements.  Pay particular attention to the timing of the D runs that involve melody notes on the higher strings with pivoting off the open fourth string."

Crowe, I have tabbed two versions of one of his signature tunes, \u201cSomehow Tonight,\u201d written by Earl Scruggs \u2013 and who knew that the Scruggsmeister is a wordsmith?  The first break is from Crowe\u2019s recording with the Bluegrass Album Band (BGAB), the version most of us are familiar with.  Note Crowe\u2019s repeated use of multiple thumb strokes on the fourth string, a cardinal feature of his blues style.  The second and third breaks are from Frank Godbey\u2019s legendary recording of the New South at the Red Slipper Lounge of the Holiday Inn, Lexington KY, November 1974.  I really prefer Crowe\u2019s attack on this version of the tune.  Note how his second break from 1974 ends with a blues riff that goes off in the ozone.  I am not sure that I got it completely right, but it\u2019s reasonably close."

This tune is clearly derived from Green Fields of America, but it has it's own charm too. It's a little crooked - for example 6 measures in the b-part) I've presented a bare-bones arrangement here that is pretty close to the fiddle transcription.(you should of course ornament to your taste) Exceptions are, there appears to be a typo in the last measure of the A part with a figure reproduced, that I removed, and I changed a double low \"e\" to an \"e\" plus high-g-drone, and I also found it fun to slide from the low e to the g instead of try some manoeuvre like an overly long reaching hammer-on, or an m-arpeggio. For the quarter notes in the first full measure, you can simply add the high-g drone, or you can actually play the notes as in Greenfields of America. Lot's of fun to play, cheers."

Crowe recorded it as Stony (sic) Mountain Twist.  The tab I have posted is more or less my own arrangement, not faithful to either Hensley's or Crowe's.  For Part C, where you crank up your Keith tuners (twisters), I have tabbed it to show the melody notes without tuners, but I added the protocol for using Keith tuners above the tab.  So you can still play it if you do not have Keith tuners, although it sounds much better with the tuners.  (It was a real bear to get the timing accurate on Part C, by the way)."

It's really helpful in picking out small variations in the song, which I found too meticulous to put in the Tab.\nI haven't copyrighted the tab in any way, feel free to distribute, but be kind and put in a nice word for me if you do so ;)\nEnjoy!"

Perhaps his signature tune is Sweet Dixie, which he recorded when he was with Jimmy Martin in the 1960s.  Emerson had written and recorded the tune earlier than that, however, and Martin\u2019s name was included because he was the leader of the band.  In any case, Sweet Dixie is a great driving piece that every bluegrass player should include in his or her repertoire.  It is formed around a percussive series of pull-offs on the first string, and buddy it is effective.  It\u2019s normally played in the key of D; so capo up 2 and go to town."

A tricky finger buster this, but a terrific exercise to get your left hand moving around the fingerboard.  If that wasn't enough, it is a delicious gentle tune that moves through several keys."

As far as the key, I thought it was A but it might be Dmaj7-9. I'm a Scruggs picker but was so inclined to learn this song so I just messed with it a little. Scott uses a lot of technique on this song and his touch and timing are so good that it makes it a great song to listen to. I might try to play the version I tabbed to give some insight on what I translated and there are a couple of phrases I play a little different than the tab but it's about 99% of what I play now.\n\n\npart 1 Dmaj7-9, Dm7-9, G7, Fmaj7, Bb9#11(b5) Dmaj7-9, Dm7-9, G7, G/A\n part 2 Bm7 Cmaj7, C#m7, F#7, Bm7, E7sus, G/A"

I also love the way Obray just vamps on the verses allowing plenty of room for the vocal performance to shine through, and also allowing for the theme to used repetitively through out the song as solo breaks.  I have just tabbed the intro, partly cos I only have a demo version of tab edit, and partly cos the  instrumental breaks are just variations of this and he simply vamps the verses, using open G, D7 and C chords.\n\nTab featured on my UK blog : http://banjosarecool.blogspot.com/2011/01/tab-down-beside-ohio-as-recorded-by.html"

Not quite a straight-forward piece, as I strove to include some of the little fiddle \"rolls\" in the tune, consisting of very quick hammer-on & pull-offs, as well as some hammer-ons & pull-offs where the melody goes below the low G string. Melodic style, with a couple instances of single-string. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

There was no banjo break on the track \u2013 J. D., where were you? \u2013 and so I worked out a break that followed Rice\u2019s chord structure (other versions may employ slightly different chords).  I have posted the tab here.  Note that the A part in the high break is shown in two flavors, one with a melodic twist and the other more single-string.  Both are difficult, but, I hope, worth the effort."

This is a near transcription [without the pyrotechnics at the end of the 2nd time round the A part] of Bela Fleck's banjo break on Haynie's original recording on the album \"A Man Must Carry On\". Note the subtle change of chords (and thus the melody) in the second time round the A part and that the B part only goes round once. It's in regular tuning with capo II. I hope you like it!"

        "desc": "Notes: This is my arrangement of my favorite Christmas tune, \"The Christmas Song\" by Mel Torme. The key is A flat (Ab hereafter), but it's not as bad as one might think. I discovered that if you drop the low D string down to a C, it sort of opens up the fretboard to the key of Ab. The low C note is the 3rd of Ab, and can be used as a drone. There are 2 G strings, which are the major 7th of Ab, and easily add a jazzy voicing to the Ab chord making it \"Ab maj7\". Also, the high G is a scale tone, so \"melodic/Keith\" style lines can still easily be played. The trickier part is in the 2nd section, where you have to play the melody and the bass line at the same time. The arrangement is meant to be played in a sort of ad lib style. This kind of timing was difficult to reproduce in TablEdit. It is reasonably close, but you can watch my video here on the Hangout to maybe get a little more realistic sense of the intended feel."

This one is fairly simple, beginner's should try to tackle it too. I will add a video sometime soon, but was anxious to share my tab with the world first. Enjoy!"

The Grey Ghost is one of his better known pieces, a nifty variation of the tune Dixie.  TGG also employs  a clever double-thumb technique, which as far as I know Emerson originated, to produce a delightful and rhythmic melodic sequence.  You will first see it in measure 3, and it is worth studying.  The tab is my version of TGG, inspired by but by no means note-for-note faithful to Emerson\u2019s various versions -- he has recorded it at least 3 times that I know of.  Note that the chord structure of the B Part in the second break changes a bit, which reflects the version of TGG on the 2011 album \"Eclipse\" by Bill Emerson."

One could quibble, I suppose, with my interpretation of the B part beginning in measure 18, where I show the notes as played on a single string (third string second fret to third string open) as opposed to melodic style (fourth string seventh fret to third string open) to achieve the same sequence of notes.  I don't know for sure which way Bobby Thompson played it, but I find the single-string approach to be easier to play."

        "desc": "Notes: Here's an old pop/jazz standard from the 40's (me thinks?), \"The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise\" arranged for \u2014 wait for it... \u2014 Twin Banjos! There are two breaks, on both breaks Banjo #1 plays the melody, and Banjo #2 does harmony. But on the first, the harmony part is a low harmony \u2014 Baritone banjo, if you will \u2014 and on the second, there's a high harmony, or \"tenor\" banjo (not the 4 string kind with 17 or 19 frets!). I would say that the melody part can be played admirably as a single banjo piece. If doing \"The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise\" as a duet, make sure you follow the tab *exactly* for the best possible sound. If you improvise a little, the banjos can clash. Hopefully this will also inspire more banjo duets with harmony. If you're feeling really bold, try getting your buddies to do lead, baritone, AND tenor \u2014 TRIPLE banjos! It does work, and sounds cool, although the melody gets buried in the harmony. The second Tabledit file has the Triple banjo parts. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

There may be a few minor errors in the tab, this is an older tab of mine which I made before I'd fully gotten the hang of tabbing tunes. Still, a good version with an ending I learned from an anonymous banjo player that works well in the key of C, standard tuning as well as this drop-C version. The first repeat is the melody. The second is basically an alternate melody and banjo licks with very little semblance to the real melody."

It's a transcription of Russ Barenberg's initial guitar break, but due to the limited range of the banjo, it has to be played an octave higher. It's a trifle tricky in places and I have put the right hand fingering in the places where I feel one might struggle. This arrangement uses all of the neck, reaching the 19th fret in the B part. Very satisfying when it starts to flow! This tune is gaining a lot of popularity in the West Country (Devon & Cornwall) so let's get it out to the world to widen its appeal! Have fun!\nPS, it's in D and don't forget to spike the 5th to A!"

Fitting it to the banjo didn't come very naturally at first, but it seems to sound much better after I tried double-c tuning, capoed at the 2nd fret. Very heavy jig rhythm, so MTM MTM or pull-offs and hammer-ons for the weak beats as is standard for clawhammered jigs on the banjo. I only marked the one place where there is an exception to that. Measures 9 and 10 require way up the fret-board playing to accommodate the mechanics of clawhammer. You finger-style players could probably come-up with a more natural way to play those measures. Hope you enjoy it, cheers!"

Hearing a tape of Bill Keith playing it helped me at that time to finalize my version, which owes a lot to him I am sure.  It is a good tune from which to begin learning melodic style."

This is a completely different tune than the tune by the same name in D major. While it is sometimes characterized as Mixolydian, it is actually a hexatonic tune, with only six, rather than seven notes in the scale. It is missing the third degree of the scale, the note which- depending on whether it were a major or minor third- would allow it to be properly characterized as either Dorian or Mixolydian. Old time tunes are often modally ambiguous for lots of reasons, one of which, like here, is that there are not enough notes to tell. This tune is probably related to the old ballad about jealousy and murder which sometimes has the same name.  The banjo is tuned gDGAD, capoed on 2."

Unfortunately, TablEdit doesn't have a voice synthesiser, so I have used midi sounds to replace the voice.  I entered the melody notes for the voice and tenor harmony as banjo tab.  The instruments are guitar, banjo and bass.\n\nI have loosely based the arrangement on the Country Gentlemen's version, although I don't know how to inject their level of drive and energy.  Also I haven't included mandolin and dobro or attempted to copy Eddie Adcock's inspired backup!  (Someone else is welcome to have a go at that.)  Instead I opted for some vamping the first time round and then some simple forward and forward-reverse rolls the second time.\n\nNote that if you should ever want to print all of this out, it runs to lots of pages.  So it is better to print out one instrument/voice at a time using the TablEdit Print Set Up menu on the Multi-Track tab.\n\nI have pitched the song in G, although the CGs do it in B (I think).  However, with TablEdit, it is easy to transpose into higher keys if required."

The intro and first 2 parts are in C, the 3rd part is in F, and the 4th part is in Bb, ending with a repeat of the 2nd part (in C). This is arranged in a Reno style, although not a tablature of his playing of the tune (which he did admirably!). It's fairly difficult, as one would expect with the key changes. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun!"

For note... on the first beat and third beat of each measure where I only show a single note being played, I am actually either hammering down into the whole chord or already holding the whole chord down. As to the note on the third beat of each measure you may also wish to modulate up, down, or stay on the same note as the first note of that same measure... to  suit your taste and depending on whether you are leaving the anticipation of leading into the next passage, or providing closure to the passage you are in."

This one is a completely banjo version, with 4 breaks, the last being a slight variation on the first. It does NOT include the second part, which is a throw-over from Don Reno's recordings of the tune (my inspiration) in which the key changes to G and the fiddle does the second part. It is in the key of C, standard G tuning. Has some funky rolls that I like to throw in there just to mess up banjo players and to make listeners say \"huh?\". I've always felt the timing in this tune had to be especially accurate to get it to sound good, so make sure you listen to one of Don Reno's recordings of it, as well as a jazz/western swing or marching band take on it. Has a Rhythm Guitar & Bass rhythm track. Have fun"

In the video David plays it a little different each verse, as usual.\nI would recommend listening to his version of the song to find variations that you might want to use when playing this yourself.\nIt might seem like a lot of stuff is going on in the tab since I've put in a few \"ghost notes\". This is just to hint that you don't have to play it note by note like a scholar. David plays a kind of two-finger thumb-lead, and the thumb brushes nearby strings now and again :)\nAs usual it sounds quite rigid in guitar pro, but should come out fairly accurate on the banjo.\nLet me know if you like it or not, any feedback is welcome, feel free to comment!"

It should be played at a moderate tempo, which facilitates playing the final measures in the second break, where I have indicated the right hand fingering.  The blues run involves several notes played sequentially with the thumb.  If you can't do this, alternate thumb and index finger.  The third break is based on the aforementioned version by Crowe."

A haunting melody, in standard G tuning and played in the Key of E minor. The 1st pages of this tab is a basic melody key, and the 2nd page is my clawhammer interpretation in 3/4 time. I've substitued D7 for the D chord since it is easier to transition from E minor to D7. Basically, the E minor chord is fretted at the D strings fretted at 2, and to make the B chord, just slide the E minor chord down to the 4th fret, and back again to E minor at the 2nd fret. I've provided alternate D measures, but there's little difference between the abbreviated D chord and D7 chord, and the D7 is a lot easier. Linked to Beginner Clawhammer, Clawhammer Gospel and Christmas Corner (It fits all 3). Lyrics and history links provided."

The first (low) break is one of the greatest IMHO, in which Crowe \"plays the words.\"  The second (high) break is more improvisational.  Both are full of goodies."

The guitar part is not taken from Lester in any way; that's the way I play in an E position (capoed up 1) on the guitar with a thumb and finger. One of the classic banjo solos of all time, in my opinion. Have fun!"

I pulled the first break off a radio recording of Flatt and Scruggs from 1957.  The beginning is a bit uncertain, because the announcer speaks over the banjo intro, but I think I got it.  The second break is more improvisational, including a Keith-ish melodic sequence, and the third break is a variation on the Scruggs approach and sticks to the melody.  This was perhaps the first tune I worked out on my own, in the early 1960s, back before there were personal computers, HD tv, or Lindsay Lohan."

I uploaded a video to the Hangout and got a request for a tab.  This is pretty much how I play the tune.\n"

This is just the first solo as I can play it, and not the 2nd or 3rd solo because I think Scott would have to tab those out.  Good luck on a really cool tune!"

I transcribed this because it was the slowest banjo playing I ever heard from Earl Scruggs and I wanted to practice some ear skills. The banjo intro and the two breaks are almost identical, so it really just is eight or nine measures worth of music.\n\nI guess I need to find a better way to typeset the bend in the sixth measure. The E note on the 4th string doesn't go up all the way to the F note, it really just is some quarter note bend. In some places I guess I haven't really got the rhythm right, especially the lick in measure 3 of the banjo break. Make sure to listen to the original a lot and play it as you hear it. Generally the whole piece has a very strong bounce to it, i.e. the first one of a pair of eighth notes is always longer than the second one."

This is one of those tunes you can get lost in and play until the strings on your banjo wear out. I think my arrangement works rather nicely on a Open G tuned banjo. Be forewarned, however,  I am one of the worst banjo players on the planet so if you just want to hear the tune I suggest playing the MIDI as I played (assuming we can call it \u201cplaying\u201d) the MP3 on my favorite banjo. Enjoy."
